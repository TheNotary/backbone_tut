## About

This little repo is where backbone.js is simultaniously explained and demonstraited in one fell swoop.  You've come to the right camp ground if you want to see how it's used in little bits at a time, so that you can gradually build the powerful bits of backbone in your own project.  I hope you brought ice packs because your backbone is in for a rigerous chiropractic meeting with a Dr. MVC!

## See It

Run

    $ camping backbone_tut.rb

Then connect to the camping app via a web browser.  


## Where are the Html pages?

Look in the views/ folder.  You'll see html.erb folder.  The main one to look at is index.html.erb.
