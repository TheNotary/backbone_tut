## About javascript/backbone_tut

This little repo is where backbone.js is simultaniously explained and demonstraited in one fell swoop.  You've come to the right camp ground if you want to see how it's used in little bits at a time, so that you can gradually build the powerful vertebrae of backbone into a spine you can trust to be oraganized enough to take care of easily.  I hope you brought ice packs because your backbone is in for a rigerous chiropractic appointment with a Dr. MVC!

## See It

    $  bundle install
    $  camping backbone_tut.rb
