## About javascript/backbone_tut

This little repo is where backbone.js is simultaniously explained and demonstraited in one fell swoop.  You've come to the right camp ground if you want to see how it's used in little bits at a time, so that you can gradually build the powerful vertebrae of backbone into a spine you can trust to be oraganized enough to take care of easily.  I hope you brought ice packs because your backbone is in for a rigerous chiropractic appointment with a Dr. MVC!

## See It

Run

    $  bundle install
    $  camping backbone_tut.rb

Then connect to the camping app via a web browser.  


## Where are the Html pages?

Look in the views/ folder.  You'll see html.erb files everywhere.  The main one to look at is index.html.erb.  To make it clean, I used partials and 'called in' markup from other files.  If you don't know about partials, you might have a more enjoyable time viewing the source of the web page directly.  You should know how to use firefox developer tools or something similar before moving on to more advanced javascript programming tricks like backbone.js =/
