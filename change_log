  - Add keyboard inputs to move a "pacman" around the board and take nibbles!

  - Add a model flow chart thing to see how you can get from a model to it's collection

In Progress:

  - Introducing collections, specifically, views where there is a shared view space for many models...
    - I need to think how this is done...
      - I have one collection with many items...
        - The render action must be over-ridden on the view to 'adjust' the models on the shared board, 
          and also render to elements on the traditional collection section in html


  - Need to customize the collection view for the events page...
    - I need to be able to access the view for a specific model... so I can update and kill off individual models
    - Maybe I should check through codeschool to see if there are events for model changes that the view should listen to?

Finished: 

  - Add collections/all.js.erb for 



* 0.0.1 *

  - Introducing versioning
  - Using models and views individually complete
